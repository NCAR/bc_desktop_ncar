# Batch Connect - Desktop

We have customized this app which is distributed as a part of Open OnDemand to work on NCAR HPC systems. Read https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/latest/enable-desktops.html
for instructions on how to configure it.

The original code had options to start several different window managers (gnome, kde, mate, etc.). Ours removes those options and starts the window manager with the startplasma-x11 command.
